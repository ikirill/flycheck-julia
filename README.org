* flycheck-julia

This is a fairly simple implementation of a flycheck checker for Julia
that uses Julia and [[Lint.jl]] to check files. At the moment, both
Julia's include and, to an even greater degree, Lint.jl have a
considerable startup time, so it isn't possible to just run them anew
every time.

It works well enough on files that define modules, because then
everything is correctly brought into scope. Quite a lot of files, even
I think in Julia's source, are written to be ~include~-ed into other
files, so neither ~include~, nor ~Lint.jl~ can handle them, and it
will show just one error, usually the first undefined symbol.

Right now this doesn't use ~lintserver~, because I didn't want to read
the file in elisp then send it to ~lintserver~, instead I send the
temporary file name that flycheck generates, and then the julia
process reads that file directly.
