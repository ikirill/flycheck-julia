* flycheck-julia

This is a fairly simple implementation of a flycheck checker for Julia
that uses [[https://github.com/tonyhffong/Lint.jl][Lint.jl]] to check files. At the moment, Lint.jl has a
considerable startup time, so it isn't possible to just run it anew
every time.

It works well enough on files that define modules, because then
everything is correctly brought into scope. Quite a lot of files, even
I think in Julia's source, are written to be ~include~-ed into other
files, so ~Lint.jl~ can't handle them well, and the errors won't be
very informative.

Right now this doesn't use ~lintserver~, because I didn't want to read
the file in elisp then send it to ~lintserver~, instead I send the
temporary file name that flycheck generates, and then the julia
process reads that file directly.

** How to use

Select the checker manually with =C-c ! s=, or add ~(add-to-list
'flycheck-checkers 'julia)~ to your init-file.
